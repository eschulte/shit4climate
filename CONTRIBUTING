## Adding Content

See the YAML top-matter at the top of the markdown already under
`topics/`, `scripts/`, and `questions/`.  New entries should also
include the same top-matter entries.

Try to strike a balance between pulling out some interesting subtopics
and brevity.

Note that the text of entries are used to pre-populate email subjects
and bodies.  Before the email body is generated all `blockcomment`s
are removed from the page text.  This make `blockcomment`s the
appropriate place to put links to extra resources or asides.
