<p>All data within the data directory is organized by state.  Within a given state directory you may find the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>legislature - people that are currently serving in the legislature</li>
<li>executive - people that are currently serving in the state executive (e.g. governors)</li>
<li>municipalities - people currently serving in local government (e.g. mayors)</li>
<li>retired - people not currently serving any tracked roles</li>
<li>committees - committee data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-this-repo" tabindex="-1">About this Repo</h2>
<p>A lot of inspiration was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">congress-legislators</a> project that has been maintaining this data for the United States Congress.</p>
<p>New as of 2021: the data/us directory is also directly ported from the congress-legislators repo, reproduced here in our schema for ease of use for people using both data sets.</p>
<p>Historically Open States has scraped this data, but given the relatively infrequent changes and the manual labor required to retire &amp; merge legislators- we have decided to move in this direction in the hopes of improving the data and making it more accessible for contributors.</p>
