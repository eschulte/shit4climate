## About Shit4Climate

Some ideas of born of aesthetics and some of need.  Shit4Climate is a
child of the later.  Personal lifestyle changes will not save
us.[^footprint] Aside from working to elect new representatives who
appropriately prioritize climate change, our only hope is to influence
our existing representatives.  Phone calls are one of the most
effective ways to do that.  Someone in the office actually has to talk
to you.
