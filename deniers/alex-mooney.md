  quote: "While covering a 2014 candidate forum in West Virginia, ThinkProgress reported: \"Mooney and Casey, however, also openly questioned whether climate change was primarily caused by humans, using the increasingly popular excuse that they're not qualified to know. Mooney said that he didn't believe that scientists had yet come to a consensus around the issue, but said the debate belongs 'in the climate change community.'\""
