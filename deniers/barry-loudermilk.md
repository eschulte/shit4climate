  quote: "In a 2017 press release, Rep. Loudermilk said: \"For several years, the EPA and other government bureaucracies have been pushing out environmental regulations based on new scientific ‘discoveries’ relating to climate change. However, the data on which these ‘discoveries’ are based have not been made available to the general scientific community for review or fact-checking. This has brought into question the overall motives of the EPA and other agencies who are demanding more environmental regulations. All regulatory decisions should be based on factual scientific information that is open and available for public viewing.\""
