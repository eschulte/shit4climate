  quote: "A columnist at The Holland Sentinel wrote that she \"recently received a letter from U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, which questioned 'the extent to which reducing American emissions would impact climate change.'\" Previously, MLive quoted Huizenga as saying: “Today’s global warming doomsayers simply lack the scientific evidence to support their claims. A host of leaders in the scientific community have recognized that the argument for drastic anthropogenic global warming is no longer based on science, but is being driven by irrational fanaticism.”"
