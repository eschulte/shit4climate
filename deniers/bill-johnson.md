  quote: "On his Facebook page, Rep. Johnson posted an article entitled \"MSNBC's Chuck Todd Keeps 'Climate Deniers' Off His Hourlong Global Warming Special,\" then wrote the following post in response: \"The issue here isn't so-called 'climate change,' but what happens the next time there is an issue Chuck Todd or other members of the media don't want to debate? Today, it's this, but tomorrow it could be the 2nd Amendment or immigration. Not giving the other side a say and refusing to hear opinions contrary to your own - that's being a real 'denier', and, it creates a chilling effect on public debate and free speech.\""
