  quote: "The Savannah Morning News reported that Rep. Carter said: \"You know of all the things we can do in the world we still can't control the weather ... And I've never bought into the climate change. I'm not naive enough to believe that we don't have some impact on it, but to think that we have enough of an impact to really change what is happening naturally, I'm not one of those who has really bought into that.\""
