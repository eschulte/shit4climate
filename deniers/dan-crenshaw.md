  quote: "On a Facebook Live feed, Rep. Crenshaw said: \"We need to have a well-reasoned discussion and debate about what is causing climate change ... We can't start off the conversation saying the climate is settled. The right way to have this conversation is to actually listen to what the science says on both sides.\""
