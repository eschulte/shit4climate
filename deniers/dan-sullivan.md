  quote: "In a 2014 interview with Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Sen. Sullivan said: “With 7 billion humans on earth, there is likely some impact on nature. The last few years clearly show, though, that there is no concrete scientific consensus on the extent to which humans contribute to climate change.” More recently, he has made comments about \"seeing the effects of a changing climate\" in Alaska; however, his office did not respond to a request for comment from CAP Action, which asked Sen. Sullivan what he believes is causing these changes."
