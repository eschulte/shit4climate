  quote: "According to WECT, Rep. Rouzer said: \"You have some scientists saying it is significantly influenced by mankind. You have some scientists say it is not influenced by mankind. Both are statements of fact ... From a public policy perspective, when you're dealing with property values, tax bases, people's lives, public policy should be based on sound science. Not the opinion of this group of scientists or that group of scientists. It needs to be real concrete science where you absolutely know for certain. The scientific community is split on climate science.\""
