  quote: "According to The Arizona Republic, when Rep. Lesko was asked at a candidate debate whether she believed in climate change, she responded: \"Is some of it, maybe, human-caused? Possibly. But certainly not the majority of it. I think it just goes through cycles and it has to do a lot with the sun. So no, I'm not a global warming proponent.\""
