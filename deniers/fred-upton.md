  quote: "MLive reported that Rep. Upton said: “We’ve experienced climate change for a long time, highs and lows. We had the coldest winter ever last winter. There was a report out that the Great Lakes are six degrees below what they were a year ago. I don’t know that climate scientists can really predict where we’re headed.” Upton has since joined the Climate Solutions Caucus but has not clarified his beliefs on the science. Rep. Upton's office did not respond to a request for comment from CAP Action."
