  quote: "In a town hall, Rep. Grothman said: \"I don't think the global temperatures have gone up very much over the last dozen or so years; I think if you look over a period of history, there are cold years and warm years and cold decades and warm decades and cold centuries and warm centuries ... Now, we're in a situation right now where I don't think we've had any horrible things happen ... it seems to me that whenever something bad happens, they blame climate change. I do think, over time, we have droughts, all kinds of good things, bad things. I don't think we have enough information to spend billions or trillions of dollars.\""
