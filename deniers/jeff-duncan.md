  quote: "In response to the October 2018 International Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, Rep. Duncan said: â€œThe climate alarmists continue to move the goalposts when their politically motivated projections do not come true. What was predicted decades ago has yet to take place. We all know that global temperatures have changed throughout the generations, but we must not look to activist climate organizations to push a false agenda in an effort to upend parts of our economy.\""
