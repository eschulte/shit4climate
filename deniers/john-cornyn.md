  quote: "The Houston Chronicle reported: \"When CBS News announced it would no longer allow guests to argue that climate change is not real, [Sen. Cornyn] offered a Sphinx-like rebuttal on Twitter: 'Science is not static.'\" Previously, The Dallas Morning News reported that Cornyn admitted that the climate is changing and that it is due in part to human activity, but he is \"not willing to put the federal government in charge of trying to micromanage the environment for the United States of America ... by putting restrictions in place that other nations are not.\""
