  quote: "In response to a question from Public Opinion, Rep. Joyce wrote: \"Like most issues that scientists face, global warming cannot be explained by one cause alone. Variations in solar energy, the cyclical changes in the tilt, the orbit of the earth around the sun, the changing oceanic circulation, as well as human effects, can ALL contribute to this problem. A simple one answer solution is not obvious. Just as all cancers cannot be assumed to be caused by one agent, Global warming is a multi-factorial problem that will require evaluation from many angles to solve.\""
