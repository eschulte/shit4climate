  quote: "In response to a question from The Dallas Morning News' voter guide, Rep. Gooden said: \"I donâ€™t deny the conclusions of the scientific community, but I take issue with those who claim to have all the answers. Climate science is imprecise and so are the consequences of any legislative action we take to address the issue. We can never be so arrogant to believe we can predict with certainty the impacts that will follow specific regulations about emissions, not only for the environment, but also for our economy.\""
