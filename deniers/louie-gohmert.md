  quote: "In a Breitbart News Daily radio clip, Rep. Gohmert said: “I also noticed, Steven, that it seems like when you hear somebody say over and over again that climate change is our biggest problem, they don’t know that climate has been changing a lot worse over all the millennia of mankind. In fact, I asked a witness, hey, is it as warm as it was back when Leif Erikson and the Norse came across to Greenland and had all those farms in Greenland? He said, it’s never gotten anywhere close to being that warm since then. Do we have any idea what kind of internal combustion engines they were using back then that was causing all this climate change?”"
