  quote: "In 2017, E&E News reported: \"'It's more of a religion ... on both sides of the issue,' Mario Diaz-Balart said when asked about global warming. Past climate legislation would have been hugely costly to businesses and people in his district, he said, with only a minuscule impact on halting temperature rise. 'I don't play that game,' he said. 'My issue is, \"All right, what is the problem that you're trying to solve?\" and \"Does it solve it?\"'\""
