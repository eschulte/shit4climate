  quote: "The Charlotte Observer reported: \"Harris is an evangelical Christian who believes in a 'Young Earth' theory that the world was created less than 10,000 years ago. He disputes the findings of a majority of scientists who say the world is at least 4.5 billion years old. 'I think there’s a lot of issues with the dating,' Harris said this week. 'And there are also bodies of scientists that also hold to a Young Earth theory. Do I believe in creation? Yes. And the creative hand of God? I do. That’s part of my faith and that’s what I believe. . . . I will continue to base my faith on the belief in Genesis.' Harris says he values science and believes the answer to issues such as climate change is 'just to be good stewards of the earth.'\""
