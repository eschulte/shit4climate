  quote: "Business Insider reported that in a debate with CNN host Chris Cuomo, then-Rep. Blackburn said: “Of course you can be a believer in clean air and clean water and realize that when you work at global warming or climate change, as it is now popularly called, that it is cyclical and you have to look at it in terms of centuries, not in terms of decades ... And the science around that is not a settled science.”"
