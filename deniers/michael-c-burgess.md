  quote: "The Denton Record-Chronicle reported that Rep. Burgess recently hosted the annual University of North Texas (UNT) Energy Summit and Fair, where regional EPA Administrator Anne Idsal spoke. When asked about her views on climate change, she said that she \"doesn't necessarily think the science has panned out on that ... there is a potential that you do have some impact from humankind throughout the globe. What exactly that impact may be or is, I don’t necessarily think the science has been settled on that.” At the end of the event, when asked about Idsal's statements, Burgess simply said, \"I don't disagree with her.\""
