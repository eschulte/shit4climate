  quote: "In an interview with Wyoming Public Radion, Sen. Enzi responded to the release of the 2014 White House climate assessment, saying, “I barely made it back here because of a May snowstorm in Wyoming. They got 18 inches in Cheyenne. It’s a little hard to convince Wyoming people there’s global warming. We have 186% of normal snow pack. That’s global warming?”"
