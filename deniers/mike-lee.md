  quote: "In an argument with a reporter on Twitter regarding what he said during NASA nominee Jim Bridenstine's Senate hearing in November 2017, Sen. Lee wrote, \"'Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities' â‰  human activities are primary drivers of trends.\" In the comment thread, the reporter posted Sen. Lee's full statement from the hearing: \"There was a discussion a moment ago about climate change, and whether or not you regard climate change as being primarily caused by human activity. It's my understanding that it's not even the position of NASA at this point that there is a consensus point. So I think it was entirely appropriate for you to defer and acknowledge your viewpoint that it is an issue, a factor, but defer to answer the question as to whether or not is the primary driver of it.\""
