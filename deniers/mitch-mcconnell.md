  quote: "Sen. McConnell told Kentucky Sports Radio: \"What I have said repeatedly is I am not a scientist. But what I can tell you is, even if you thought that was important—and there are some scientists who do and some scientists who don't—but even if you thought that was important, the United States doing this by itself is going to have zero impact ... it's not a yes or no question. I am not a scientist ... There are different opinions among scientists.\""
