  quote: "In a recent hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Rep. Brooks implied that rocks were causing rising sea levels, rather than climate change: \"What about erosion? Every time you have that soil or rock, whatever it is, that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise because now you've got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up.\""
