  quote: "Virginia Public Radio reported: “Griffith says the US alone can't make an impact on the earth’s atmosphere because China and India use so much coal. 'Because what’s happening is they’re spewing all that into the atmosphere in Asia and other parts of the world that are still using coal and then what happens is that it floats through the atmosphere, we all share the same atmosphere. So if you only look at the United States, if you take that position that we’re just going to fix the U.S., we’re not going to fix the rest of the world by doing that.'\""
