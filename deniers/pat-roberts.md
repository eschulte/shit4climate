  quote: "HuffPost reported on a speech Sen. Roberts delivered in 2013: \"But Roberts, who receives poor ratings from environmental groups, avoided linking the natural disasters to any kind of human-generated climate change, suggesting Mother Nature simply has it in for America. 'I don't know what we've done to Mother Nature, but she sure hasn't been very kind to us,' Roberts said.\""
