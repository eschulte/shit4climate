  quote: "Rep. Gosar tweeted, \"The Paris Climate Agreement won't change the climate but it will bankrupt the US. Also, it's unconstitutional.\" Additionally, in a press release that accompanied the tweet, he maintained: “President Trump ran his campaign on the idea of putting America’s interests first. He can fulfill that pledge in a big way by using his authority to completely withdraw the United States from the misguided Paris Climate Agreement. This unconstitutional treaty is nothing more than an extension of the Obama Administration’s ideological war on affordable energy. This liberal pipedream abdicates our sovereignty in favor of a global redistribution of wealth. Furthermore, this scheme was designed to favor our economic rivals like China and India by giving them until 2030 to reduce emissions while the United States front-loaded our costs at the expense of American jobs.\""
