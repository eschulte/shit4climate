  quote: "In a CNN interview, now on YouTube, Sen. Paul said: \"So I don't think we should be alarmist about this. I mean, the planet is 4.5 billion years old. We have gone through great extremes of climate change, natural and now we may have a man-made influence as well, but these peopleâ€”the question I always ask these alarmists is: How much is nature and how much is man? They act as if it's a given that man is the only source of climate change? Well, my goodness, the great climate changes in our history all happened before the industrial revolution. So, is there climate change? Can man have an impact? Yes. But let's don't be so alarmist as to say such outrageous things that if we don't sign the Paris accord, there's going to be mass extinction? That is a ridiculous statement.\""
