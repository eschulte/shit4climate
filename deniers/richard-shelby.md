  quote: "In response to a letter from Weld for Birmingham contributor Tom Gordon, Sen. Shelby responded: “Important scientific research is ongoing, and there are still many questions that must be answered before we take steps to address this issue. For example, is the climate change phenomenon cyclical or is it a function of man-made pollutants, or both? I believe the science must be firmly grounded before we take any actions that could seriously cripple many sectors of our economy.”"
