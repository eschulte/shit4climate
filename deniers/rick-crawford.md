  quote: "While speaking to radio station KASU 91.9 FM, Rep. Crawford fielded a question regarding climate change and then-President Barack Obama’s environmental agenda: “There’s not sound science to support some of the initiatives that the President, I think, is committed to. We know that some of the research was faulty and it drove a lot of the agenda for a long time. And then it turned out there were some questions about the validity of that research.” He continued, “I don’t see a lot of the green initiatives that are being talked about being supported by scientific data, but more supported by political agendas.”"
