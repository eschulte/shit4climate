  quote: "As reported by the Sandusky Register in 2018: \"Portman said he believes the Earth is warming; the data is clear. It’s less clear on how much of that is man-made, but 'I’m willing to err on the side of saying that human involvement is part of it,' he said ... Summing up his [climate] change views, Portman said, 'I believe we know enough to know we have to do something. I believe there are some sensible things we can do that don’t have a big negative economic impact.'\""
