  quote: "In early 2015, Mashable reported that Sen. Wicker was the only senator to vote against an amendment that stated, “Climate change is real and not a hoax.” In a statement after the vote, Wicker reportedly said: “I agree with the more than 31,000 American scientists who do not believe the science on this matter is settled. Scientific research is advanced by asking questions and allowing for multiple viewpoints.”"
