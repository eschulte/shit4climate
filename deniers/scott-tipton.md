  quote: "When asked whether he thinks that humans play a role in climate change, Rep. Tipton responded: \"I think that we've got a role to play. We need to take an advantage of new technology ... We're all in concert in terms of making sure that it's done right, and the role that we as humans have to play is making sure that we are good stewards.\""
