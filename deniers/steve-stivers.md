  quote: "In a 2018 interview with News Journal, Stivers said, \"It is clear the climate is changing to me.\" However, later on, he said: \"We need to figure out how to create negative-emissions technology that can be used to essentially clean like a vacuum cleaner cleans this floor. Negative-emissions technology would take emissions and change them and put more oxygen and less carbon dioxide in the air ... It's called global warming, not America warming.\""
