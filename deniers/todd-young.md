  quote: "In a video published by WLKY, Sen. Young said: “My mind remains open about various scientific questions and so forth. We’re often told there’s a consensus among scientists, and I’ve come to discover, as the number of scientists I talk to and the number of things I read, that’s not necessarily the case.\""
