  quote: "Alpha News reported that in response to President Trump rolling back the Clean Power Plan, Rep. Emmer said, “President Trump has rolled back the Obama Administration’s most harmful environmental regulations—including the Clean Power Plan, which has cost many American jobs and has driven up energy costs for American families.” Previously, while on the floor of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Emmer gave a speech in which he stated, \"Just because we make these chambers available to Will Steger and the crowd that wants to rely on Al Gore's climate porn doesn't mean that that's the way it is. There is another side of the story.\""
