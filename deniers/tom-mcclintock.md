  quote: "Time reported: \"'The climate has been changing for four and a half billion years,' McClintock said in a Sept. 23 [2018] debate with his Democratic opponent. 'The extent to which human activity has a role to play is being hotly debated right now.' He offered a similarly inaccurate statement during an Oct. 8 debate hosted by KQED. 'Thereâ€™s no question that global temperatures have been warming on and off since the last ice age,' he said. 'The question is what are we going to do about them.'\""
