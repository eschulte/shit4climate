From [healthline: How to Recognize Gaslighting and Get Help][], Signs
of gaslighting:
- no longer feeling like the person you used to be.
- being more anxious and less confident than you used to be.
- often wondering if you're being too sensitive.
- feeling like everything you do is wrong.
- always thinking it's your fault when things go wrong.
- apologizing often.

intentionally gaslighting me?  Would you tell me?

- Politicians back legislation that is wildly insufficient to the

  globe currently have us on a "[Catastrophic Pathway][]."
