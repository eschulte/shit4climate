This year was horrible, with an [unbearable record setting summer][].
It was also the best year humanity has left.  Between the [ongoing
fires][], [hurricanes][], and floods (notably in [Europe][] and
[China][]) it has been a shocking year for the world.  But carbon
accumulation in the atmosphere is *cumulative*.  So every year there
will be more carbon than the last, and the fires, floods, hurricanes,
refuges, mudslides, heatwaves, death, and destruction will be worse
than the year before.

If you have kids, think about how depressing it is that *every year of
their lives will be worse than the last*.
