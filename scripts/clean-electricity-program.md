brief: An essential part of the reconciliation bill.

I'm asking if you will commit to voting **NO** on the upcoming
reconciliation bill unless it includes a Clean Electricity Payment
Program.  Such a program is essential to reducing America's carbon
emissions, and also to convincing the rest of the world that America
is taking climate change seriously.  Without this clean electricity
program America will not be able to leverage other countries into
making similarly strong carbon reduction commitments in the upcoming
[UN Climate Change Conference in November][].

> NOTE: The $3.5T reconciliation bill will either pass fulfilling the
> bulk of Biden's agenda or fail along with Democrats chances in 2022.
>
> This bill is likely the only chance at meaningful legislative action
> on anything before 2022, including climate change.
