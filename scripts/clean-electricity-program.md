brief: An essential part of the reconciliation bill.

I'm asking if you will commit to voting **NO** on the upcoming
reconciliation bill unless it includes a Clean Electricity Payment
Program (CEPP).  This program is *essential* to reducing America's
carbon emissions, and also to convincing the rest of the world that
America is taking climate change seriously.  Without this clean
electricity program America will not be able to leverage other
countries into making similarly strong carbon reduction commitments in
the upcoming [UN Climate Change Conference in November][].

Currently Joe Manchin opposes the CEPP (as reported [by nytimes][] and
also [by politico's Morning Energy][] which is "Presented by Chevron"
ðŸ˜¢), and the white house is reportedly rewriting the bill to remove
the CEPP.  We need senators to commit to only supporting the
reconciliation bill if it includes CEPP.  It's worth mentioning that
the Manchin family owns a coal company and that the senator himself
make roughly 1/2 a million dollars off of this company just last year.
