I'm asking if you will commit to only confirming new members to the
federal reserve board who have a history of directing monetary policy
to address climate change.  Examples of excellent candidates include:
[Sarah Bloom Raskin][], and [Lisa Cook][].

The Federal Reserve's mission is to keep our economy at full
employment and protect our financial system.  The climate catastrophe
we see unfolding around us will ripple through our financial system.
See "green swan," I'm happy to [google green swan][] for you.  It is
core to the Federal Reserve's mission to ensure that our financial
institutions are in shape to withstand these shocks.  The Fed. should
be taking climate related preparatory actions including:
- Ensure banks to treat climate change as a structural risk
- Ensure banks exposed to carbon producing companies are prepared to
  accept the losses expected in those sectors as the economy moves to
  zero carbon emissions,
- Force large banks to run climate stress tests.
