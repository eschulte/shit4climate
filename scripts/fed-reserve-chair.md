I'm asking if you will commit to supporting Leal Brainard as the new
Chair of the Federal Reserve and push back against other candidates
that take Climate Change less seriously (including the current
Fed. chair Jerome Powell).  Leal recognizes the structural risk
climate change poses to the US economy, and is the only viable
candidate that is willing to use the power of the Fed. to address this
risk.

See Leal's 2021-03-23 speech [Financial Stability Implications of Climate Change][].
