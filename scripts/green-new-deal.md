I'm calling to ask if you will commit to supporting the Green New Deal
-- House Resolution 109.  We need a bill of this scope to fight
climate change at the scale that scientists know is required to
preserve anything close to a livable world, country, state, and city
for future generations of Americans and Humanity.

This crisis demands immediate action.  Will you commit to making the
advancement of this legislation a top priority?


### Goals of the Green New Deal
- to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers;
- to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States;
- to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st century;
- to secure clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment for all people of the United States for generations to come; and
- to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, de-industrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.
