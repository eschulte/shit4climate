As the House Panel brings in Oil Companies to testify before Congress,
please hold these companies accountable and force them to speak to the
fundamental incompatibility of their business with a livable plant.

For example, ask how they plan to transition away from the extraction
of carbon over the next ten years.  If they don't then is their
business plan compatible with a livable planet?  If not then should
they be allowed to follow that business plan?

Please ask hard questions and press for complete answers that
acknowledge the reality of our dire situation.

Don't be fooled by disingenuous [support for a carbon tax][] or
discussion of [carbon footprints][], which are all just horse shit.
