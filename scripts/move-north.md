brief: We must preserve our way of life, in Canada.

I'm asking if you will commit to directing the Department of Defense
to prepare plans for the invasion of Canada.  America's traditional
way of life, the small farmers who make up the historical lifeblood of
our country, have grown the same crops for generations. These crops
only thrive in specific bands of temperature and weather.  As these
agrarian bands move north it is our *duty* to follow them, for the
farmers.

Don't take our word for it, [renowned scientist agree][].
