I'm asking if you will commit to supporting a direct tax on
carbon emissions.  A direct carbon tax is the simplest and likely most
cost effective way to force our economic system to deal with climate
change.  By leveraging the power of markets and the economic
innovation and efficiency markets unleash a carbon tax is our best
chance of reducing emissions in time to preserve a livable world for
future generations.

The money raised by this tax could be given directly back to the
American people as a flat monthly dividend.  This support will lessen
the impact of the tax on the poorest Americans while the uniform
distribution will not counteract the financial disincentives on carbon
emission.

3623 economists have signed on to a statement supporting a carbon tax.
