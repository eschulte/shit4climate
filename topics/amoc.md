As the polar ice caps are melting into the ocean the cold water is
interrupting the northern portion of the massive Atlantic ocean
spanning loop that circulates warm water and air out of the tropics
and up into northern latitudes.  It's basically a massive
planet-spanning heat pump.  If it stops circulating, then parts of
Europe may temporarily get colder and the tropics could get *much*
hotter.
