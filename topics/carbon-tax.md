A direct carbon tax is the simplest and possibly most cost effective
way to force our economic system to deal with climate change.  If you
make something expensive markets will find the cheapest way to avoid
it.  As the article cited above notes, despite overwhelming evidence
that a carbon tax would be effective it has never gained political
support.  No country with significant fossil fuel companies has ever
sustained one.

Some high points:

- An [Economists’ Statement on Carbon Dividends][] (the "The Largest
  Public Statement of Economists in History") has the support of (at
  last count) 3623 economists supporting a carbon tax.

- This form of tax is potentially one of the few climate policies that
  can survive a conservative supreme court.  Taxation is squarely in
  the legislature's power.

- It has never been particularly politically popular.  (But maybe that
  will change now that the country is on fire.)
