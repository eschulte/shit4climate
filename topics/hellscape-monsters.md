The world is on track to its hottest period since the [Cretaceous
Thermal Maximum][].  Given that there is no indication that the
governments and corporations running our world are either willing or
able to change this course, we might as well bring back some animals
that will thrive in the coming hellscape.  Our children shouldn't have
to suffer a post-apocalyptic world *without* monsters.

So before our technological capabilities collapse (along with existing
ecological, weather, and political structures) why not have scientists
bring back some [late cretaceous dinosaurs][]?  From classics like
T-Rex ![T-Rex][] to fun surprises like the Bambiraptor
![Bambiraptor][] and shit, maybe bring along some extinct conifers,
ferns, and ginkos too?  Better to have monsters alive than nothing at
all.
