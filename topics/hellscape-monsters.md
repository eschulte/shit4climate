The world is on track to its hottest period since the [Cretaceous
Thermal Maximum][].  As there's no indication that our systems of
governments and corporations are either willing or able to change this
course, then we might as well bring back some animals that will thrive
in this coming hellscape.  Our children shouldn't have to suffer a
post-apocalyptic world *without* dinosaurs and monsters.

So before our technological capabilities collapse along with existing
ecological, weather, and political structures; why not have scientists
bring back some [late cretaceous dinosaurs][]?  From classics like
T-Rex ![T-Rex][] to fun surprises like the Bambiraptor
![Bambiraptor][] and hell, maybe bring along some extinct conifers,
ferns, and Ginko-adjacent plants?
