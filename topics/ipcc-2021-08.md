The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  This AR6
working group is composed of 234 authors from 66 countries with 517
contributing authors, over 14,000 cited references, 78,007 expert and
government review comments and the final report was approved by 195
member governments.

See the IPCC's own top level summary of this report in the [IPCC AR6
WGI Headline Statements][].  These emphasize that (1) the effects of
climate change are only going to worsen over the next thirty years
under all possible emission scenarios and (2) *now* is the critical
short window in which we must reduce carbon emissions to avoid the
worst scenarios.
