What's a rational response when the party you're supposed to vote for
if you care about climate puts someone who made 1/2 a million last
year from his family's coal company in charge of climate legislation
in their only chance to pass meaningful climate legislation?

See:
- [NYTimes coverage of this issue][].
- This document [obtained by politico][] signed by Manchin and Schumer
  codifying Manchin's jurisdiction over climate standards and stating
  (among other things) that the reconciliation bill *will* include
  carbon capture over coal and natural gas and *won't* undo tax breaks
  for fossil fuels! ðŸ˜¡

What to do?
- Call Manchin and just weep into the phone [202-224-3954][]
- Maybe it's time to give up on government and consider civil
  disobedience.  See [If our governments wonâ€™t stop climate change,
  should we revolt? Extinction Rebellion says yes.][].
- Work on your [post-apocalypse skills][].  Maybe ask your
  representatives to start funding free classes for apocalypse
  survival skills.
- Figure out how to [get an anti-anxiety prescription][]
- Start drinking more (highly recommend [Cocktail Codex][])
- Read up on [how to apologize to your children][]
- Come to terms with the possibility that politicians are gaslighting
  you.  (See [Are you gaslighting me?]({{ "/questions/are-you-gaslighting-me"|url }}))
